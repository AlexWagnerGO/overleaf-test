In the scope of the present study three hypersonic stability codes are compared based on hypersonic high enthalpy boundary layer flow around a $\unit{7}{\degree}$ blunted cone. The code to code comparison is conducted between the following codes: the  NOnLocal Transition analysis code (NOLOT) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Stability and Transition Analysis for hypersonic Boundary Layers code (STABL) of University of Minnesota and the VKI Extensible Stability and Transition Analysis code (VESTA) of the von Karman Institute. The comparison will focus on the role of real gas effects on the second mode instability, in particular its frequency and growth rate. The experimental test cases for the code to code comparison are provided by the DLR High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel G\"ottingen (HEG) and the JAXA shock tunnel HIEST.

\section{Introduction}

Laminar to turbulent transition in high-speed boundary-layers is of high importance for re-entry vehicles since early transition results in an increase in the heat transfer by factors between 3 and 8, resulting in a cost and weight increase of thermal protection systems \cite{Schneider_1999,Schneider_2004}. The second mode instability, commonly referred as Mack mode \cite{Mack_1984}, is the dominant mode for essentially 2D boundary layers at high local Mach number ($M\hspace{-0.08cm} a_e > 4$) and/or cold walls\cite{Mack_1984}. Thus the second mode is in the main focus of the investigations of this paper. High speed vehicles and re-entry vehicles operate in an high enthalpy range. In this range real gas effect occurs, which can include molecular rotation, molecular vibration, chemical dissociation and exchange, electronic excitation, radiation and ionization. In this paper the high enthalpy effects on the second modes are investigated. The numerical investigations are performed with three different stability codes, which are compared against each other: the NOLOT code of the DLR, the STABL code from the University of Minnesota and the VESTA code of VKI. The base flow as well as the stability calculations itself are performed with and without real gas effects for the comparison.\\

Further the stability results are compared against low and high enthalpy experiments, which were performed on a blunted $7^\circ$ half-angle cone model. Two of the chosen experiments for the comparison were performed in the DLR High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel G\"ottingen (HEG) and one additional experiment was performed in the JAXA High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel (HIEST).






\section{Wind tunnels and wind tunnel model}\label{sect:model}
\textcolor{magenta}{I will add my comments in that section.}
For both wind tunnels a similar, not the same, cone model is used: a $7^\circ$ half-angle blunted cone with an overall length of about $1 \hspace{0.05cm} \rm m$ and an nose tip radius of $2.5\hspace{0.05cm} \rm mm$ (see picture \ref{fig:cone_model}). Both models were equipped with thermocouples and pressure transducers. The models were supported by a sting system at nominal $0^\circ$ angle of attack.\\

	\caption{JAXA $\unit{7}{\degree}$ cone model.}
	\label{fig:cone_model}
\end{figure}

Two of the chosen experiments for the comparison with the numerical codes were performed in the HEG. The tunnel is a free piston driven shock tunnel, which allows to investigate flow past hypersonic flight configurations from low altitude Mach 6 up to Mach 10 at approximately $33 \hspace{0.05cm} \rm km$ altitude. In this operating range, total specific enthalpies of up to 22 MJ/kg can be reached.\cite{Hannemann_2008} The two investigated HEG experiments in this paper have a unit Reynolds numbers of $Re_{\rm m} = 1.4 \times 10^6 / \rm m$ at different enthalpies (see table \ref{tab:test_cases}). As reference case, one experiment with low enthalpy (HEG-Low-E) is chosen. The second selected HEG experiment is with high enthalpy (HEG-High-E). Additionally, a high enthalpy experiment, performed by JAXA in HIEST (HIEST-High-E), which is in a comparable range of the high enthalpy test case of HEG, is selected for the numerical analyses.

\textcolor{cyan}{The focus in the paper is the numerical comparison, thus the description of the wind tunnels is very short. Please, feel free to add some sentences.}\\

\section{Numeric methods}
\subsection{Base-flow solver}
The laminar base-flows $\bar{q}$, which are required for the stability codes, are calculated by different CFD solvers, which are not described in detail here. For example, one used code is the DLR TAU code. The TAU code is a three-dimensional parallel hybrid multi-grid code and has been validated for hypersonic flows (see e.g. Mack et al.\cite{Mack_2002}). All base-flow calculations of the different codes based on constant free stream condition, which are listed in table consider real gas effects, based on thermochemical non-equilibrium gas modeling with 5 species for air: $N_2$, $O_2$, $NO$, $N$, $O$. Constant free stream conditions, which are listed in table \ref{tab:test_cases}, are used. Deviations from these agreements,  are explicitly mentioned in the text. As one example of the base-flow calculation figure bla shows the low-enthalpy test case (see also table \ref{tab:test_cases}: HEG-Low-E). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pics/heg_low_e_base_flow.jpg}
	\caption{Example of base-flow (HEG-Low-E. test case)}
	\label{fig:cone_model}
\end{figure}

Please mentioned, that also different grids for the base-flow calculations are used (adapted and non-adapted grids, which has an influence of the necessary point number; see also section \ref{sect:grid}:grid convergence).

\subsection{LST/PSE solver}
The equations of the stability codes are derived from the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy, which govern the flow of a viscous, compressible gas. All flow and material quantities are decomposed into a steady laminar base flow $\bar{q}$ and an unsteady 
disturbance flow $\tilde{q}$\
\begin{equation}
q(x,y,z,t)=\bar{q}(x,y)+\tilde{q}(x,y,z,t).
\end{equation}
The  laminar base-flow $\bar{q}$ are calculated by different CFD codes, which solves the Navier-Stokes equations, and can be used without and with chemistry. The disturbance $\tilde{q}$ is represented as a harmonic wave
\begin{equation}
\tilde{q}(x,y,z,t)=\hat{q}(x,y)\exp[i(\alpha x + \beta z - \omega t)]\label{wave}
\end{equation}
with the complex-valued amplitude function $\hat{q}$. \\

All codes can be used for Linear Stability Theory (LST) as well as Parabolized Stability Equations (PSE) analyses. In contrast to STABL and VESTA, which can exclude or include chemistry, NOLOT is limited on the perfect gas assumption.  

\subsection{STABL}
\textcolor{blue}{It make sense to describe one code in more detail and not all codes. The STABL code is the code with the most options (especially, the chemistry option), thus I would suggest to describe the STABL code in more detail. Please, add a description of your stability code.}
\subsection{VESTA}
\textcolor{green}{The code is made of different components dealing with the different aspects of the stability equations solution: derivation of a generic set of equations, generation of an automated implementation and a set of solution algorithms associated to different ansatz.\\
In order to perform the different tasks the VESTA toolkit is coded in MAXIMA, MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and fortran. 
The toolkit has been tested against several cases available in the literature such as the one in Malik \cite{Malik:1990}, Arnal \cite{Arnal:agard1994} and \"{O}zgen and K{\i}rcal{\i}\cite{Ozgen_Kircali:2008}.\\
Several solvers are available within VESTA, namely LST, PSE and BiGlobal. They are all able to cope with different regimes from incompressible to compressible flows with LST and PSE dealing with chemical reactions. The numerical method currently in use is based on a Chebyshev collocation method similar to the one described by Malik\cite{Malik:1990}. A set of Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto points has been chosen
\begin{equation}
x_j=\cos\left( \frac{j \pi}{N}\right).
\end{equation}
Given a function $v$ defined on the aforementioned points,  it is possible to obtain its derivative by defining a polynomial $p$ that satisfy the usual condition for an interpolation problem $p(x_j)= v_j$ for $j=0,\ldots,N$ and then computing its derivative $w_j = p'(x_j)$.This is a linear operation and it could be represented as a simple multiplication by an $(N+1)\times(N+1)$ matrix $w = D_N	\cdot v$. Note that $m$-th order derivative could be easily computed by $\left(D_N\right)^m$.\\
The algebraic mapping proposed by Malik \cite{Malik:1990} has been used to transform Chebyshev polynomials defined in $x=[-1,1]$ to the physical domain $y=[0, \infty)$ (truncated arbitrarily in $y=[0, y_{max}]$)
\begin{equation}
 y = a \frac{1 + x}{b - x};
\end{equation}
where $b= 1 +2a/y_{max}$ and $a=y_i y_{max}/(y_{max}-2y_i)$ with $y_i$ corresponding to the location $x=0$.\\
For the current set of calculations four homogeneous boundary conditions are applied to $\tilde{u}$, $\tilde{v}$, $\tilde{w}$, $\tilde{T}$. These homogeneous Dirichlet b.c. can be easily plugged into the collocation method by skipping the first and the last rows and columns [$D_N$ becomes a $(N-1)\times(N-1)$ matrix]. Two zeros at the extremities of the resulting $w$ could be appended so that the final vector has the correct dimension.\\
In case of a Neumann boundary conditions the problem could be stated by extracting the corresponding row from the matrix $D_1$.
As nothing is prescribed on pressure, one could either use a staggered grid as in Khorrami \emph{at al.}\cite{Khorrami_Malik_Ash:1989} or introduce a compatibility condition on pressure. This could be achieved by re-writing the y-momentum equation at the boundaries and adding them to the system as new equations to be solved:
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{\partial \hat{p}}{\partial y} \right|_{y=0,y_{max}}= X_{0,m}.
\end{equation}
The variable vector gains two more variables, namely $\tilde{p}_0$ and $\tilde{p}_N$, and two new equations are introduced by appending two rows and two columns to the matrices reaching a final dimension of $\left( 5N -3 \right)$.

\textcolor{red}{the rest is just old stuff from the abstract, which I will replace soon}
This section summarized the first results of the numerical comparison. In figure \ref{fig:1324_n_x} the N-factors of the second mode calculated by NOLOT as a function of the normalized $x$-position are shown for different frequencies. Out of this diagram the N-factors can be extracted from sensor positions of the experiment for various frequencies, which is visible in figure \ref{fig:1324_n_f} for the three pressure sensor positions of the HEG-High-E experiments.

	\caption{$N$-factor as function of the frequency - numerical results (NOLOT and STABL)}
	\label{fig:1324_n_f}
\end{figure}

The second mode is amplified in streamwise direction. Due to the increase of the boundary-layer thickness the frequencies of the distribution are shifted to lower values, which can be explained with the following relation between boundary-layer thickness $\delta$ and wavelength $\lambda$\cite{Stetson_1984, Mack_1984}\hspace{0.02cm}: $\lambda \approx 2 \hspace{0.1cm}\delta$. The calculations with NOLOT, marked by solid lines, neglected here the real gas effects (for the base flow calculations as well as the NOLOT analyses). In contrast, the base-flow calculations for STABL and the STABL calculations (dashed lines) itself include chemical effects, which results in higher amplified second modes and additional in a lightly shift of the frequency range.\\

These numerical results will be compared with the experimental measurements for all mentioned test cases of table \ref{tab:test_cases}.
